Project Overview:
Our application is created to facilitate verification of CV for companies, especially in an open house environment. Our project’s phenomena is that after completion of each course the course work done by each student will be inserted in the node of a blockchain which will happen each semester till the completion of degree. The approved stakeholders will be able to search all the work done by students during their degree tenure. Our project is using the private, permissioned and a custom built Blockchain framework to achieve the mentioned goal. Blockchain technology will provide us a decentralized and secure P-2-P system. The reason for using this technology is to provide authenticity, transparency to the work done by the student at the end of his degree. Major plus point is the time saving and transparent record keeping for both the university and the employers.

Problem Identification and Motivation:
Employing a candidate is a lengthy and complex process involving many verifications throughout the process. This takes too much time and in a saturated industry where applications to a job exceeds more than 100 candidates makes it impossible for the Company to check and verify everyone.
According to “resources.workable.com” it takes on average about 28 days to finally clear and verify a person for a successful hiring. Moreover, keeping a transparent record of the professional career of a student or a former employee is also a real world problem.
Following time-taking steps are the reason present manual verification method is not feasible
Education Verification:
Among the 1 out of 6 candidates who lied on their resume, 1.56 percent misrepresented information about their education in 2017 (Ref: AuthBridge’s Annual Trend Report). And this 
Employment Verification:
No CV validation process can be complete without a comprehensive employment history check. A whopping 12.14 percent of all reported job applicants misrepresented information about themselves related to their employment history.
Identity Verification:
If an applicant is not the person he or she claims to be, chances are their entire resume is a lie. In 2017 alone, as much as 4,352 candidates provided fake IDs (Aadhaar, PAN, Passport, Voter ID) etc
Address Check:
6.67% of applicants provided false information regarding their address in 2017 as reported by The Economic Times.
Reference Check:
It’s a common practice among many job applicants of today to provide false reference letters or fake referees. In fact, 2.99 percent of cited referees did not respond in the year 2017, while 3.35 percentage of discrepancies in resumes were related to references.


 
Alternatives:
1.	Applicant Tracking System:
Companies have invested in their own Applicant Tracking Systems to reduce hiring time but that still is not feasible because still companies have to verify the CV completely and it still is a time taking process. Eventually the concept of Applicant Tracking System has failed in the long run.
2.	Project Repository:
A Github like project repository can be formed by the University to keep records of projects and skills of Students but this method is still not transparent as People with access to repository may change the data or Some universities may even try to “fake” the data to give advantage to their students in hiring process. This method also is flawed.
3.	Appii.io
is a website which does background checks and CV verification using blockchain, the major problem with this site is the logic behind it that it asks the university to verify the authenticity of student’s degree and then finally store it in blockchain. The step of “asking the university” is where transparency can be damaged and this still is time-taking step.
4.	CV Verification Companies:
These companies are hired by employers just for the sake of verifying the potential candidate. This kind of service is not available in Pakistan and is also expensive and a time taking process. So this method is not suitable for Pakistani Markets. “https://www.verifile.co.uk/services”
 
Goals and Objectives:
1.	To provide transparency to record keeping.
2.	To make student records and CV a time efficient process.
3.	To make hiring employees easier.
4.	To make a rich user friendly social experience CV for students.
5.	To keep a unified record of all Professional experience and education. 
 
Features of Project:
● Employers at open house could search for specific projects and
specific skills they want from our app/website without any hassle of
verifying or testing the candidate themselves
● Coursera/Udemy projects can also be added to the University's
Blockchain after proper evaluation by respective instructors.
● University own repository ( like Github ) can be integrated with the
Blockchain system to keep a thorough history of what and when the
student made the project so that the same project can be used in
Future.
● Verifiable CV’s can be given to GlassDoor so that international
employers can also easily verify local employees.
Expected Outcomes:

A time saving, transparent, unchangeable system will help the university, students, employers and other stakeholders in hiring, verification and record keeping of individuals.
