## Project Overview:
Our application is created to facilitate verification of CV for companies, especially in an open house environment. Our project’s phenomena is that after completion of each course the course work done by each student will be inserted in the node of a blockchain which will happen each semester till the completion of degree. The approved stakeholders will be able to search all the work done by students during their degree tenure. Our project is using the public and a custom built Blockchain framework to achieve the mentioned goal. Blockchain technology will provide us a decentralized and secure P-2-P system. The reason for using this technology is to provide authenticity, transparency to the work done by the student at the end of his degree. Major plus point is the time saving and transparent record keeping for both the university and the employers.
 
### Goals and Objectives:
1.	To provide transparency to record keeping.
2.	To make student records and CV a time efficient process.
3.	To make hiring employees easier.
4.	To make a rich user friendly social experience CV for students.
5.	To keep a unified record of all Professional experience and education. 
 
### Features of Project:
- Employers at open house could search for specific projects and
specific skills they want from our app/website without any hassle of
verifying or testing the candidate themselves
- Coursera/Udemy projects can also be added to the University's
Blockchain after proper evaluation by respective instructors.
- University own repository ( like Github ) can be integrated with the
Blockchain system to keep a thorough history of what and when the
student made the project so that the same project can be used in
Future.
- Verifiable CV’s can be given to GlassDoor so that international
employers can also easily verify local employees.

### Expected Outcomes:
A time saving, transparent, unchangeable system will help the university, students, employers and other stakeholders in hiring, 
verification and record keeping of individuals.
